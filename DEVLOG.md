# DEVLOG — Penumbra on Supersonic

Append-only. One entry per session: what was built, what broke, dead ends, decisions, numbers.

## 2026-09-27 — session 1: understand, scaffold, contract

**Built.** Mapped the original with an 8-reader workflow plus a critic (docs/spec, ~92k words).
Found the exact engine build the game shipped on — Ethanon 0.7.12, SourceForge SVN tag v0-7-12 —
and GS2D r485 as a stand-in for the closed GameSpaceLib; both in gitignored reference/. Ran the
original from a scratch copy (it works on Windows 11 with a HIGHDPIAWARE compat flag) and captured
the menu. Scaffolded the repo on the Magic Portals pattern and wrote the Eth contract headers.

**Decisions.** Port the AngelScript to C++ over an emulated 0.7.12 runtime (not embed AngelScript,
not re-derive gameplay from data). One Ethanon frame per 60 Hz tick. Snapshot taken at 0.7.12's
render point, before callbacks. Ivan: enhanced from the start, PT+EN, assets in place.

**Dead ends.** The original's menu ignores Enter unless the (hidden) cursor entity is over a button:
it is mouse-driven through CollideDynamic. First capture was offset by DPI virtualisation.
