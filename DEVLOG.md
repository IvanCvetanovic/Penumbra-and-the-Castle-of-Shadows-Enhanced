# DEVLOG — Penumbra on Supersonic

Append-only. One entry per session: what was built, what broke, dead ends, decisions, numbers.

---

## 2026-09-27 — session 1: understand, scaffold, contract

**Built.** Mapped the original with an 8-reader workflow plus a critic (docs/spec, ~92k words).
Found the exact engine build the game shipped on — Ethanon 0.7.12, SourceForge SVN tag v0-7-12 —
and GS2D r485 as a stand-in for the closed GameSpaceLib; both in gitignored reference/. Ran the
original from a scratch copy (it works on Windows 11 with a HIGHDPIAWARE compat flag) and captured
the menu. Scaffolded the repo on the Magic Portals pattern and wrote the Eth contract headers.

**Decisions.** Port the AngelScript to C++ over an emulated 0.7.12 runtime (not embed AngelScript,
not re-derive gameplay from data). One Ethanon frame per 60 Hz tick. Snapshot taken at 0.7.12's
render point, before callbacks. Ivan: enhanced from the start, PT+EN, assets in place.

**Dead ends.** The original's menu ignores Enter unless the (hidden) cursor entity is over a button:
it is mouse-driven through CollideDynamic. First capture was offset by DPI virtualisation.

## 2026-09-27 — session 1 (continued): the game runs, whole

**Built.** eth runtime + 25 scripts (9c64f8a); render/ + layer (abbc062); engine Ogg Vorbis (abb9e8a)
and window control (a516b7c), both additive and announced to the Magic Portals session; English
image variants; live shadows to the light's reach; ten headless gameplay scenarios.

**Numbers.** 13 suites, 2593 checks, 0 failures. Level 1 at 1024x768 against the original's capture:
sampled pixels within 2 levels. Scenarios: 458 checks, 0 script aborts, no port bug.

**Broke / dead ends.** Smart App Control refused freshly linked executables (Penumbra.exe twice in a
row) until every exe carried an icon, VERSIONINFO and a manifest; with them, none was refused again.
The first lighting comparison looked "too dark" - it was the widescreen framing and a different
moment, not the lighting: a pixel-aligned 1024x768 capture matched. A menu capture depends on the
live mouse (cursor.ent follows it) - hence --cursor.

**Decisions.** E7 (lv20 / lv31+), E9 (shadow length), R4 exception for generated English art.

## 2026-09-27 — session 1 (night): standing statues, highlights, options, a package

**Built.** Engine f30df7c + b999491 (vertical 2D sprites, gloss highlights; opt-in, bit-identical
for everything else; announced and green-lit by the Magic Portals session before the push). The
original's Settings screen gained the enhanced rows (E10). Interpolation between ticks (E8). A
runtime path resolver and tools/package.bat; README.md; LICENSE.md + the LGPL/GPL texts;
Penumbra.exe without a console, logging to %APPDATA%\Penumbra\penumbra.log.

**Numbers.** Menu against the original, per-region mean error: left pedestal 24.4 -> 12.9, lower-left
barrel 27.9 -> 3.9. Level 1 at 1024x768 byte-identical through the round. 13 of 15 suites run,
2345 checks, 0 failures.

**Broke.** Smart App Control keeps refusing test_pn_boot and test_pn_formats specifically (three
links each), and test_materials in the engine's own build - whatever it keys on, relinking does not
move them. Recorded as not run; their ground is covered by test_pn_scenarios.

## 2026-09-28 — session 2: a pause, pad menus, six more scenarios, one test executable

**Built.** E13, a pause (render/PauseMenu): Esc or player 1's Back in a level or an arena freezes
the Machine under Resume / Main menu, the music at 40%, and opens by itself on a focus loss; Main
menu feeds the original's own Esc for one tick. E14: a pad's A and B confirm and cancel in the
menu-like screens. The options screen gained a smooth-motion row (E8, E10). test_pn_scenarios gained
scenarios 15-20. tests/all builds every suite into test_pn_all, which runs each in a child process
of itself.

**Numbers.** test_pn_all: 16 suites, 3716 checks, 0 failures (render_pause 312, scenarios 916).
Paused capture run: every pixel outside the pause panel identical from frame 130 to 180 (paused
from tick 120 to 190).

**Broke.** The full build's Penumbra.exe was refused by Smart App Control (exit 126); one relink
with a real change (--help lists --tour) was accepted. test_pn_all was accepted on its first launch,
and with it test_pn_boot and test_pn_formats ran for the first time since Step 5.

**Decisions.** Original bugs found by the new scenarios (the `play_sound.ent` horror markers that
never play, the off-screen second summon, the 50-mana refusal) are pinned, not fixed, pending Ivan.

**Session 2, later.** E15 (the misnamed horror markers play). The round's gates: test_pn_all once,
16 suites, 3719 checks, 0 failures. Mistakes, owned: a capture loop launched a freshly relinked
Penumbra.exe eight times after Smart App Control had refused it (eight notifications), and later a
build-then-run chain relaunched a refused test_pn_all because the edit meant to relink it had not
applied. Rule written down (memory + CLAUDE.md rule 5 practice): launch a new binary once, alone,
and only after the build log shows it was relinked.
